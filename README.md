# Accounting-for-Startups
This script will generate the P&L since inception, balance sheet as of a certain date, inventory in various warehouses or entities, and also a complete list of journal entries for a simple company with various shopfronts and a warehouse.

If more balance sheet categories are present, please map them manually in the script so that the result appears in the order A--> E --> L.

Underlying assumption is that the transaction list will be updated accurately.
