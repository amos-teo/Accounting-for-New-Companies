With an input of the date from the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD, this script will generate the P&L Year to Date, balance sheet as of a certain date, inventory management in various warehouses or entities, and also a complete list of journal entries for a simple company with various shopfronts and a main warehouse.

If more balance sheet categories are present, please map them manually in the script so that the result appears in the order Assets --> Equity --> Liabilities.

Underlying assumption is that the transaction list is updated accurately until the input date for which you want to generate the statements and inventory for.
