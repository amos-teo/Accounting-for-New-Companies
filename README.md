With an input of the date from the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD, this script will generate the P&L Year to Date, balance sheet as of a certain date,statement of changes to equity (common stock and retained earnings), cash flow statement, inventory management in various warehouses or entities, and also a complete list of journal entries for a simple company with various shopfronts and a main warehouse.

For the previous year data, P&L will include P&L Year to Date and Balance Sheet will show the previous year's quarter end data.

If more balance sheet categories are present, please map them manually in the script so that the result appears in the order Assets --> Equity --> Liabilities.

Underlying assumption is that the transaction list is updated accurately until the input date for which you want to generate the statements and inventory for. 

Average costing methodology is used for calculating inventory cost value.

Manual inputs in the code are needed to sort t-accounts out into Assets, Liabilities, and Equity.

Sample data is provided which showcases how data should be kept.
